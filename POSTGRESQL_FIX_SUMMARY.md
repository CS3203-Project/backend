# PostgreSQL Column Case Sensitivity Fix - Summary

## Issue Fixed
We resolved the PostgreSQL error: `column s.postalcode does not exist` (Code: 42703)

## Root Cause
PostgreSQL treats column names as case-sensitive when enclosed in double quotes. The column was defined in the schema as `postalCode` with a capital "C", but was being referenced inconsistently in SQL queries.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed the SQL Query Formatting**:
   - Updated all column references in raw SQL queries to use proper double quoting
   - Changed column references from `s.columnName` to `s."columnName"` format
   - This ensures PostgreSQL treats column names with the exact case as defined in the schema

2. **Fixed Object Property Reference**:
   - Corrected an issue with the embeddings update query that had malformed property access
   - Changed from `embeddings."title"Embedding` to `embeddings.titleEmbedding`

3. **Added Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Implemented try/catch blocks around SQL queries
   - Added detailed logging for query execution
   - Provided fallback mechanisms for errors

## Remaining Tasks

The service matching functionality should now work correctly. However, for consistency, consider implementing these best practices:

1. **Use Double Quotes Consistently**:
   - Apply the same quoting convention to all other SQL queries in the project
   - Create a utility function to generate properly formatted column references

2. **Update Schema Naming Conventions**:
   - Consider using snake_case for database columns to avoid case sensitivity issues
   - Or maintain strict camelCase with proper quoting throughout

## Testing

The service matching functionality should be tested thoroughly with:
1. Searching with and without category filters
2. Pagination to ensure result sets are returned correctly
3. Different types of services to ensure vector similarity works correctly

The code has been updated and the server has been restarted to apply the changes.
